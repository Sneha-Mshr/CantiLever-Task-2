# ðŸŽ­ Credit Card Fraud Detection
  
This project detects fraudulent transactions in credit card data using **Machine Learning**.

---

## Overview
Credit card fraud is a major issue in the financial industry.  
Using machine learning, this project helps identify fraudulent transactions by:
- Preprocessing data
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Training a logistic regression model
- Evaluating accuracy with confusion matrix & classification report

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib

---

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).  
- It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
- Highly imbalanced: only 0.172% of all transactions are fraudulent.
